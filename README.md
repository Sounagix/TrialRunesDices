# Isometric2DGame

This project was created as part of a technical assessment for Runic Dices. It is developed using Unity 2D URP (version `6000.0.24f1`) and focuses on implementing key gameplay systems in an isometric 2D environment.

## Description

**Isometric2DGame** is a prototype designed to demonstrate core game development skills, including:

- Unity project setup and GitHub version control
- Isometric player movement using Unity's New Input System
- AI behavior using a basic state machine
- A custom gameplay system (Combat, Inventory, or Dialogue) based on specialization

## Completed Tasks

Task 1: Unity Project Setup and GitHub Integration  
Task 2: Isometric Player Movement and Input System  
Task 3: AI State Machine for Enemy Behavior  
Task 4: Basic Combat System

## Planning & Time Estimation

| Task        | Description                              | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Task 1      | Project setup + GitHub integration       | 2.0 h          | 0.45h       |
| Task 2      | Isometric movement + Input System        | 5.0 h          | 6.30h       |
| Task 3      | Enemy AI with FSM                        | 7.0 h          | 5.45h       |
| Task 4.1    | Implement a Basic Combat System          | 7.3 h          | 8.45h       |
| Task 4.2    | Implement a Simple Inventory System      | 9.0 h          | 10.3h       |
| Task 4.3    | Dialogue System						     | 13.3 h         | 7.5 h       |
